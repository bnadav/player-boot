<p>In all probability, residents of the early medieval village or town enjoyed <br />healthier conditions, for all the crudeness of sanitary equipment inside and<br />outside the house, than their more prosperous 16th-century descendants.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This was due to the establishment, in the Middle Ages, of public bathhouses.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Sometimes run by private individuals, but more often by the local municipality, <br />these bathhouses were common institutions in medieval European towns.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Their existence was an indication of the importance attached to cleanliness <br />at the time.</p><p>A visit to the public bathhouse involved both bathing and steaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was <br />customary to engage in such extensive cleaning at least once in two weeks <br />and sometimes even weekly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Roman bathhouse, the medieval<br />bathhouse was a meeting place which promoted social contact.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paintings<br />of the period depict people gossiping and eating together at the bathhouse,<br />unembarrassed by bodily exposure.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, at the bathhouse one could<br />be treated for pains and inflammatory conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;So popular was bathing in<br />the Middle Ages that the practice even spread to the rural districts, whose<br />inhabitants had once been called &quot;filthy pigs.&quot;</p><p>By the 16th century, however, bathing had become less popular throughout <br />Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Frankfurt, which had 29 bathhouse keepers in 1387, had <br />none in 1530.&nbsp;&nbsp;The scarcity of wood in the vicinity of large cities had made<br />heating large quantities of water prohibitively expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bathing became a<br />luxury that only the upper classes could afford.</p><p>In the 19th century, in an attempt to show that they had progressed beyond <br />the uncleanliness and disorder that had prevailed in urban life for some time,<br />many cities created public bathhouses in poor neighborhoods.&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt those<br />city officials would have been astounded to learn that they were returning to a<br />common medieval practice.</p>
